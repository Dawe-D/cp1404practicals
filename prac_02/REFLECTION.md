# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

20 - 30% I have been to seminars and looked over the powerpoints also. 
I know these are not substitutes for lecture videos.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Time = no time allocated yet. 
Location = home study otherwise Science Place, Library, or Engineering. 
Duration = no duration yet. 
Time and duration I am organising a small weekly schedule.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Unsure so far.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Trying to brute force a solution.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Not allocating time to have it worked on in a timely manner and brute forcing solutions.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Unsure, I have begun to look at previous work and spend more time analyzing for a solution than forcing one.
